Normalized CSVs that were used   

employees.csv  

departments.csv  

n_dept_manager.csv  

n_ emp_data.csv  

n_salaries.csv   

n_title_list.csv   

n_titles.csv   


Normalization involved creating unique identifiers for the csvs that contain n_ prefix. 
To normalize the titles.csv required a for loop to append title_ids for each row in order to be able to 
drop the title name.
